# Legal Tender Guild Roster Exploratory Data Analysis
This is a personal project that I undertook utilizing the Blizzard API to extract data for my guild and provide some basic Exploratory Data Analysis to identify gaps in our guild that would allow us to redistribute and reclass characters as necessary to fill gaps in our roster.
Various functions and exploratory data analyisis of the Legal Tender Guild on the Lightbringer server utilizing the Blizzard API.
