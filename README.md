# Legal Tender Guild Roster Exploratory Data Analysis
This is a personal project that I undertook utilizing the Blizzard API to extract data for my guild and provide some basic Exploratory Data Analysis to identify gaps in our roster makeup allowing us to redistribute and reclass characters as necessary. Such diversity allows a guild to maximize its flexibility and organize effective raid groups rapidly.

The project includes various functions and exploratory data analyisis of the Legal Tender Guild on the Lightbringer server utilizing the Blizzard API.
